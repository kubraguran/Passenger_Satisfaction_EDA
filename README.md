# Passenger_Satisfaction_EDA

In this project, I analyzed the "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" dataset from Kaggle.
The goal was to understand the data by doing statistical summaries,
checking and handling missing values, detecting outliers,
and visualizing both numerical and categorical variables with graphs.
This helps to learn more about passengers' satisfaction and the data quality.


# What we did

- Calculated basic statistics like mean, median, min, and max values
- Checked for missing values and their percentages
- Imputed missing values using model-based method (Random Forest)
- Detected outliers using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method
- Visualized data using different plots for numerical and categorical features
